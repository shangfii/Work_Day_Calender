## Technologies used:

1. HTML


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. [This article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) gives a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
 
2. CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

3. JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
